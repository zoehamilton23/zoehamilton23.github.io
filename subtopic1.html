<p class="p1"><span class="s1">How Technology Affects Mental Health<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li2"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s3">Technology has created very bad mental health issues to develop throughout all different kinds of people but mostly in teenagers and young adults. All of these different social media platforms that have been created for a person to enjoy one’s self has turned into a place of insecurity and comparing. On Instagram, TikTok, Youtube, Snapchat, and more we are seeing these influencers or celebrities living the “perfect lives”. However in reality a lot of the things we see people posting are photoshopped pictures of themselves and people not showing every single aspect of their life. People posting pictures showing off their body brings a lot of insecurity to people and they feel as though they will only be happy if they look like them, which they develops eating disorders and body dysmorphia. The people that show all the good things happening in their lives are most likely shielding the negative aspects in their life so they come off as “perfect”. Technology also creates a place for people to be able to be cyberbullyed which develops anxiety and depression in a person. Overall social media, which technology has brought to us, is a place that we all love but it comes with cons that are very detrimental to people mental health.</span></li>

<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s3">The thing about technology that we aren’t understanding though, is that we are the problem not technology. Technology was created to better our live in many different ways but not everyone using technology is using it for the right reasons. For example, the people that use their platforms to cyberbully someone just for the fun of it or just to make the person feel bad. We use technology for an optimal amount of the things in our day to day lives but we are abusing our power with it. All of the negative things that come from technology are technically coming from us because we are the ones using it. Of course everyone is going to love their phones, laptops, tv, game, etc, but as a community things can get better.</span></li>
