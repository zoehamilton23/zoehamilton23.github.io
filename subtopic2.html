<p class="p2"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s2">We tend to look down when we are on our gadget, whether that be a phone or a laptop. When we are sitting in these positions it puts strains on our neck and our back because it is in an uncomfortable position for a long period of time. It has gotten so bad to the point where they use technology terms to describe a pain like “selfie elbow”. Another technology strains is our eyes when we look at the screens for too long. People will look at their screens all day if they wanted to but in reality everyone needs a break from the blue light and small text on our screens. It is hard in a world like today to not always be on your electronics<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>due to work, school, and entertainment. However, there is a way to know how to balance your electronic time and your non electronic time. Basically most of the world today is addicted to their gadgets and although it may not affect us physically majorly, it could get worse.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><a href="http://usa.kaspersky.com/resource-center/preemptive-safety/impacts-of-technology-on-health"><span class="s5">usa.kaspersky.com/resource-center/preemptive-safety/impacts-of-technology-on-health</span></a></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><span class="s6"></span><span class="s2">Another major things that technology affects is our physical activity. People will stay inside all day on their phones, watching TV, playing games, or whatever they may be doing. However, that is not a lifestyle that you want to be stuck in because it is crucial to be physically active even just for 30 minutes a day. Our physical activity plays a big role in our weight and our health, so it\'92s alright to want to go on our electronics but balance it out and make sure you get your physical activity in for the day. It also tends to affect our sleep which is a very important thing we need to do. We tend to stay up at night on our phones or watching TV, and even when we do fall asleep the blue light affects our internal clock when it is time for bed. There are definitely modifications everyone can take to change their lifestyle around.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
