<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">Technology has helped us in many ways. From communication, to healthy, to entertainment, technology has really made the world into batter place. We can call people in an instant or post on social media to keep up with our friends lives. Imagine a world where you couldn’t call anyone in an instant even for an emergency. Well everyone knows about how communication is a very big part of lives but what about our health. Our healthcare has improved extensively over the years due to the technology we have. Without the level of technology we have we would not be able to cure as many sicknesses or save as many lives.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>

<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3">Technology has also brought us the internet, and trust me without the internet we would not be in a good place. We use the internet for our day to day lives when it comes to school, work, entertainment, and much more. Without the internet we would be doing evening on paper which is not beneficial to us or the earth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An example of the internet being very beneficial was during the Covid-19 pandemic where the whole world had to go into lockdown and no one could go into school or work. We turned to a life of online school and working from home so that we could carry on with our lives. Without the internet everything we do in our everyday lives would become a lot harder.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
